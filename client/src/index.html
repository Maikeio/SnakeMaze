			First of all, the shaders used in this scene were written by myself :D
			I'm pretty happy with the result and <b>I even got mentioned</b> in an
			<a href="https://simonschreibt.de/gat/pokemon-rapidash/#update2" target="_blank">article</a>
			at the end. Thx alot to Simon Trümpler &lt3.
			<br>
			<br>
			Below you can read what inspired me to do this project,
			how I did it and what resources I used for the effects. 
			And of course what I learned.
			<br>
			The effects I'm going to describe are:

			<ul>
				<li>Lighting model</li>
				<li>Normal Maps</li>
				<li>Deferred lighting</li>
				<li>"Volumetric" Fog</li>
				<li>Terrain</li>
				<li>Skinning</li>
				<li>Shell Texturing</li>
				<li>Flames on the fox - triplanar mapping - noise fields</li>
				<li>Volumetric Flames - Stencilbuffer - uv distortion</li>
			</ul>



			<h2>What was my motivation?</h2>
			I love the idea of web-based games and services
			because everyone can try them out without any hassle
			and the barrier of downloading something is removed. Or is it removed?
			<br>
			But unfortunately, good-looking 3D experiences with envoirements are hard to implement.
			In my previous projects with my former employer,
			we still tried and used the light mapping approach
			to implement a demo VR shopping experience.
			Although this obviously solved the problem of realistic lighting,
			it had a huge side effect. Due to the size of the resources,
			the loading times were immense.
			So a big advantage of choosing the web as a platform was lost.
			<br>
			Nevertheless, I personally wanted to get closer to this dream,
			so I started to explore the possibilities of real-time lighting.
			That's how I ended up here, exploring ground-up shaders.


			

			<h2>Lighting model</h2>
			I'm using the good old phong lighting.
			On the hand, I started
			this project with the help of the book "GLSL Essentials" by Jacobo Rodríguez
			,and he did a good job of introducing it.
			On the other hand, because I didn't have time to look deep enogh
			into it, to fully undestand the math and I'm not a fan
			of copying math functions.
			<br>
			I also added some fresnel for stylisation, one source was this
			<a href="https://lettier.github.io/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners/fresnel-factor.html" target="_blank">article</a>
			by David Lettier.
			<br>

			<h2>Normal Maps</h2>
			Something that hit my by suprise and
			I didn't thought of as a problem.
			But it was, so I learned about tangent space.
			Again I appreciated the help of
			<a href="https://lettier.github.io/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners/normal-mapping.html" target="_blank">David Lettier</a>.
			<br>

			<h2>Deferred lighting</h2>
			One goal from the start was to be able to use a lot of lights,
			so that wouldn't be a problem in atmospheric scenes.
			This was the reason for looking into deferred lighting. I was very happy to
			find this handy
			<a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Deferred-Shading" target="_blank">tutorial</a>
			by Joey de Vries.
			<br>

			<h2>"Volumetric" Fog</h2>
			A volumetric fog would be nice for the ambience,
			but true volumetric fog with shadow cameras and depth
			testing isn't an option for webgl or so many lights.
			So I was quite happy when I found
			<a href="https://ijdykeman.github.io/graphics/simple_fog_shader" target="_blank" >this</a>
			simplified solution by Isaac Dykeman.
			Rendering at full resolution was still too expensive,
			so I did an extra pass at a lower resolution.
			I was also able to adjust the math to compensate for a height
			limit to keep the fog low.

			<h2>Terrain</h2>
			It's (obviously) a vertex shader,
			that displacing the vertices based on a heightmap with scrolling uvs.
			I blurred it a bit in the distance to reduce flickering and created
			normals based on the heightmap.
			The map is generated with a ractal Brownian Motion and turbulence.
			The last part I learned from the fantastic
			<a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/13/", target="_blank">The Book of Shaders</a>
			by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo and Jen Lowe.


			<h2>Skinning</h2>
			A scene without a cute, or whatever I can archive,
			character wouldn't be half as appealing,
			but a character needs animation.
			And since Three.js already has support
			for skinned animations with animation textures,
			I decided to go down that route with the help of
			<a href="https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-skinning.html" target="_blank">this article</a>.
			<br>

			<h2>Shadow mapping</h2>
			The fox always looked somewhat floating, I thought about using a fake shadow,
			because setting up shadow cameras for every light wouldn't run at all.
			But than I thought about just using one orthographic camera for all
			the lights, and guess what, it works. Thanks to
			<a href="https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-16-shadow-mapping/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>,
			the only problem I had to work around,
			was my deferred lighting setup.
			I solved this by first applying the shadow camera's projection
			and view matrix to each fragment of the lighting pass.
			But I ended up adding another output
			to the model renderer before the lighting pass,
			containing the calculated frustum position.

			

			<h2>Shell Texturing</h2>
			At this point I started to take a step towards visual effects.
			To give the furr at least some depth,
			I used shell texturing. The inspiration for this effect
			came from a YouTube 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dr-tRQzij4" target="_blank">Video by Acerola</a>.
			


			<h2>Flames on the fox - triplanar mapping - noise fields</h2>
			Because of my growing interest in vfx, I read a few articles on the subject,
			including
			<a href="https://simonschreibt.de/gat/divine-fire/" target="_blank">The Divine Fire</a>
			by Simon Trümpler. It covered the use of triplanar mapping to texture
			something for vfx without using a secound uv map.
			Now I knew how to map something, but had no texture to map.
			Luckily I read
			<a href="https://sighack.com/post/getting-creative-with-perlin-noise-fields" target="_blank">this article</a>
			about noise fields and how to create generative art.
			So I got my inspiration for these flames.
			But rendering them in reatime was impossible,
			so rendering them into a flipbook was the solution.




			<h2>Volumetric Flames - Stencilbuffer - uv distortion</h2>
			Another VFX trick from Simon Trümpler! In his article
			<a href="https://simonschreibt.de/gat/pokemon-rapidash/" target="_blank">Pokémon – Rapidash</a>,
			he explains how to combine a simple volume with a stencil
			to create a neat flame.
			For the volume I used the flame texture of the fox,
			but I had no nice single flame shilloute.
			Guess what, this problem was solved by yet another article
			by Simon Trümpler. Specifically, his 
			<a href="https://simonschreibt.de/gat/stylized-vfx-in-rime/" target="_blank">talk at the ADDON Conference</a>,
			where he describes how to create a flame with some uv distortion based on noise.
			Combining the two, I created 
			<a href="https://madeio.net/flame/" target="_blank">this</a>
			lovely flame.
