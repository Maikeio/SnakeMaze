			First of all shaders used in this scene a wirtten by myself :D
			<br>
			It follows a summary what drove me to create this project,
			how I implemented and what ressources I used for the effects.
			And ofcause what I learned.
			<br>
			The effects I'll discribe are:

			<ul>
				<li>Lighting</li>
				<li>Normal Maps</li>
				<li>Deferred lighting</li>
				<li>"Volumetric" Fog</li>
				<li>Terrain</li>
				<li>Skinning</li>
				<li>Shell Texturing</li>
				<li>Flames on the fox</li>

			<h2>Lighting</h2>
			I'm using the good old phong lighting model.
			On hand I started
			this project with the help of the book "GLSL Essentials" by Jacobo Rodr√≠guez
			and he did a good job introducing it.
			On the other hand, because I had no time looking deep enogh
			into it, to undestand the math fully and I'm not a fan
			of copying math functions.
			<br>
			I also added some fresnel for stylizing, one ressource was this
			<a href="https://lettier.github.io/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners/fresnel-factor.html" target="_blank">article</a>
			by David Lettier.
			<br>

			<h2>Normal Maps</h2>
			Something that hit my by suprise and
			I didn't thought of as a problem.
			But they were, so I learned about tangent space.
			Again, I apreciated the help of
			<a href="https://lettier.github.io/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners/normal-mapping.html" target="_blank">David Lettier</a>.
			<br>

			<h2>Deferred lighting</h2>
			One goal, since the start, was the ability to use many lights,
			so this wouldn't be a problem in athmospharic scenes,
			so I looked into deferred lighting. I was very pleased to
			find this handy
			<a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Deferred-Shading" target="_blank">tutorial</a>
			by Joey de Vries.
			<br>

			<h2>"Volumetric" Fog</h2>
			For the ambience a volumetric fog would be very nice,
			but true volumetric fog with shadow cameras and depth
			testing isn't an option for webgl or so many lights.
			So I was quiet happy when found I
			<a href="https://ijdykeman.github.io/graphics/simple_fog_shader" target="_blank" >this</a>
			simplified solution by Isaac Dykeman.
			Which in fact was still to expencive to render at full resoultion,
			so I render it at a lower resolution in an extra pass.
			I also was able to adapt the math to compensate for an hight limit,
			so the fog stays down.

			<h2>Terrain</h2>
			It's (obviously) a vertex shader,
			that displaces the verticis based on a heightmap with scrolling uvs.
			I blurred it a bit in the distance to reduce flickering and create
			normals based on the heightmap.
			The map is generadet with a ractal Brownian Motion and turbulences.
			About the last part I learned in the awesome
			<a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/13/", target="_blank">The Book of Shaders</a>
			by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo and Jen Lowe.


			<h2>Skinning</h2>
			A scene without a cute, or what I'm capable of to archive,
			character wouldn't be half as apealing,
			but a character needs animation.
			And with Three.js already bringing support
			for skinned animations with animation textures,
			I decided to go down that path with the help of
			<a href="https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-skinning.html" target="_blank">this article</a>.
			<br>

			
			

			<h2>Shell Texturing</h2>
			At this point I started to go a step towards visiual effects.
			To give the Furr at least some depth,
			I use shell texturing. The inspiration for this effect
			I got by a YouTube 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dr-tRQzij4" target="_blank"> Video by Acerola</a>.
			

			<h2>Flames on the fox</h2>
			Because of my started interest in vfx a read some articles about the topic,
			including

			<h2>What was my motivation?</h2>
			I love the idea of web based games and services,
			because everybody can try them without hassle
			and the hurdle to download something is removed. Or is it?
			<br>
			But sadly good looking 3d experinces with envoirements are hard to implement.
			In my privous projects with my former employer we tried non the less and took the approache of
			lightmapping to implement a demo VR shopping experience.
			Even tho this obviously solved the realistic lighting problem,
			it brought a huge side effect. Because of the size of the ressources
			you had immense loading times.
			So one big benefit of choosing web as a platform fell down.
			<br>
			Never the less, I personally wanted to get closer to this dream,
			so I looked deeper into the possibilitys of realtime lighting.
			From reading break downs of some modern games running on lower
			performance hardware, it seems, that on of the factors for
